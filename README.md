# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository is a collection of personal implementation of a variety of algorithms using C++. You may find more than one implementation for these problems but using a different algorithm strategies, optimizations or even different programming languages.

NOTE: All implementations assume that input always satisfies the requirement.

## Requirements
In able to compile and run project, make sure `clang` or `gcc`, `make` (or `MSBuild` on Windows) and `cmake` are installed.

CMake is optional, it helps you build and run project easier, but you could manual run each file separately.

Clone repository by `git clone` to your local computer:
```shell script
$ git clone git@github.com:kntilde/algorithm.git
$ cd algorithm
```

## Build and run C++
Using CMake:
1. Create _build_ directory at project root:
```shell script
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
2. Build project with `cmake` and `make`, remember we are currently in _build_ folder:
```shell script
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
If you are on Windows use `MSBuild` instead of `make`:
```powershell
cmake ..
MSBuild.exe .\algorithm.sln
```
3. All binary files are located inside _build/bin/_ directory.

Using `clang` or `gcc` compiler:
1. Compile your desired file by compiler:
```shell script
$ clang++ -std=c++20 [path_to_source_file] -o [path_to_output_file]
```
or
```shell script
$ g++ -std=c++20 [path_to_source_file] -o [path_to_output_file]
```
2. Then run compiled binary file:
```shell script
$ ./[path_to_binary_file]
```
For example:
```shell script
$ clang++ -std=c++20 sorting/merge_sort.cc -o build/bin/merge_sort
$ ./build/bin/merge_sort
```

Add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` or `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` argument to `cmake` command for `Debug`, `Release` respectively.
